# Session Context

## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Remove trail enable/disable commands and related functionality

## Context
The user wants to simplify the trails feature by removing the ability to enable/disable trails. Trails should always be active — only `create` and `update` commands remain. The `list` and `show` (default) commands also stay since they're read-only.

## Changes

### 1. `cmd/entire/cli/trail_cmd.go`
- Remove `newTrailEnableCmd()` and `newTrailDisableCmd()` function definitions
- Rem...

### Prompt 2

Create a branch, commit the changes

### Prompt 3

Rename the branch, it's actually about adding trail functionality not removing. That's just from experimenting.

### Prompt 4

Is the branch up to date with main?

### Prompt 5

dip@dip cli % entire trail update
Updated trail for branch feat/trails I'd expect to get a list of options here?

### Prompt 6

"done" and "closed" should not be selectable in the CLI for now. "done" means "merged" and closed should only be done by people with permission which we don't have the information available at this point.

### Prompt 7

commit

### Prompt 8

There are many more uncommited changes?

### Prompt 9

Yes and commit

### Prompt 10

Clean up this "remove-trail-enable-disable    Rename the branch, it's actually abou... in_progress   Daniel Adams    1h ago" trail.

### Prompt 11

push the branch

### Prompt 12

Fetch latest main and merge into this branch.

### Prompt 13

Does creating a trail also check it out automatically? (it should not).

### Prompt 14

But it does create the branch as well no?

### Prompt 15

Fuck yes, it should create the branch.

### Prompt 16

It should not check out the branch, just create it and push up both the branch and the trail data to the shadow branch. For auto checkout, let's actually put a step in the interactive create flow and a flag "--checkout" or something.

### Prompt 17

When I'm on a trail/branch I still want to be able to create other trails: dip@dip cli % entire trail create
Trail already exists for branch "feat/trails" (ID: 247b47f901d4)

### Prompt 18

First prompt should be title and then the branch derives from that unless user chooses to change: dip@dip cli % entire trail create
┃ Branch name
┃ > feat/trails

enter submit

### Prompt 19

What are the trail create parameters now?

### Prompt 20

Description is missing from interactive and status too.

### Prompt 21

push

### Prompt 22

The trail branch isn't pushed to origin after creation which defeats a bit the purpose. Not only the trail but also the branch need to be pushed.

### Prompt 23

How is the user determined for the Trail?

### Prompt 24

For my current user it's "Daniel Adams" but I need it to be the github username.

### Prompt 25

"entire trail list" only lists local but not remote trails. Should be both.

### Prompt 26

Clean up all the this-is-a-test branch and trail
