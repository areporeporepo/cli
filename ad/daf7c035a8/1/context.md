### Prompt 1

Base directory for this skill: /Users/alex/workspace/cli/.claude/skills/debug-e2e

# Debug Entire CLI via E2E Artifacts

Diagnose Entire CLI bugs using captured artifacts from the E2E test suite. Artifacts are written to `e2e/artifacts/` locally or downloaded from CI via GitHub Actions.

## Inputs

The user provides either:
- **A test run directory:** `e2e/artifacts/{timestamp}/` — triage all failures
- **A specific test directory:** `e2e/artifacts/{timestamp}/{TestName}-{agent}/` — debug one...

### Prompt 3

### Prompt 4

[Request interrupted by user]

### Prompt 5

you should know I've just run these against a branch build of the cli

the auto commit failure is expected

### Prompt 6

have a look at the test.json - was there any clues in the pane output?

### Prompt 7

in interactive mode? yes it would

Q: does this test use entire 'manual' mode?

### Prompt 8

yes, do both - after each WaitFor and in cleanup

### Prompt 9

commit this

### Prompt 10

I guess it was a flake? the last run only has the autocommit failure yes?

### Prompt 11

check the new run I've just done

### Prompt 12

pane.txt is empty though, can we capture it before session.Close?

push

ah, we have to remove the --strategy flags from our entire calls in e2e tests

### Prompt 19

push, then trigger the E2E workflow please

### Prompt 20

we have more feedback about the shadow branches being left behind - can we do a post-check in all of our scenarios (where we don't expect to have them). It seems like it's a common failure mode for us.
